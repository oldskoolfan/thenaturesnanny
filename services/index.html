                        Perhaps you are going on a well deserved vacation, or a last-minute business trip pops up. Maybe
                        a few days are needed for your pet to adjust to the arrival of a new family member. And don’t
                        forget moving or strangers (i.e., carpenters, painters, etc.) can be stressful on our pets. The
                        Nanny and her family will give your pets the love and nurturing they deserve and give you peace
                        of mind!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nature’s Nanny wants to ensure that your pets are in their “home-away-from-home” so we do
                        everything we can to maintain your pet’s routine, including meals, sleeping arrangements,
                        medications and other needs they may require.

                        <p>
                            Unlike most boarding facilities, your pets are NEVER alone overnight.

                    <h2>Specialty Services</h2>

                    <h3>Puppy Care</h3>
                    <p>Because we are not a typical boarding facility we are able to accept puppies at a younger age
                        than other boarding facilities. Pupies receive extra special attention for crate training, potty
                        training, including letting them out throughout the night, and basic commands. Because dogs are
                        pack animals by nature they learn great socializing skills at an early age playing with their
                        new friends at the Nanny’s. And we will also do our best to use the same training techniques,
                        command words and rules that will be used in your home.</p>

                    <h3>Convalescent and Senior Care</h3>
                    <p>The Nanny has many years experience with convalescing pets and senior care. As our beloved pets
                        age they need extra loving care to ensure their senior years are happy, safe and secure. The
                        Nanny’s family will provide the necessary medications, extra potty breaks, special
                        accommodations for those that need a quieter environment and other required care, such as
                        special meals, injections, IV fluids or bandages changes. By arrangement the Nanny will
                        transport your pet to your vet appointments, MedVet, OSU etc…</p>

                    </section>
                    <h3>Other Fur and Feathered Care</h3>
                    <p>The Nanny welcomes bunnies and birds of all sizes. Since these pets have their own unique
                        personalities, we will have a consultation to coordinate your pet’s special needs (play time,
                        cage cleaning, treats, etc.)</p>

                    <h3>Pets on the Move</h3>
                    <p>The Nanny has experience with and can provide travel preparations for regional, cross-country or
                        even international travel for your pets. This can include preparing for air travel and
                        compliance with state or country pet transport regulations such as vaccines and obtaining
                        veterinary documentation. In unique cases, the Nanny’s family can provide transportation
                        services, based on availability.</p>
